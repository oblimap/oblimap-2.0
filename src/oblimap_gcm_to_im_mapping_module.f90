  SUBROUTINE oblimap_gcm_to_im_mapping()
    ! This program reads several field variables from a Global Circulation Model (GCM) netcdf file,
    ! which are projected by an oblique stereographic projection on a rectangular Ice Model (IM)
    ! grid. The GCM grid point coordinates are projected on the IM grid, where in general they fall
    ! irregular and between the IM grid points. Therefore the field values defined on the GCM grid
    ! points have to be interpolated at each IM grid point, with help of the nearby projected GCM
    ! grid points. Two interpolation methods are available in this program both based on a distance
    ! weigthing Shepard technique. One method, the 'quadrant method', searches within each quadrant
    ! around each IM grid point the nearest projected GCM point and interpolates with help of this
    ! four points to obtain the field value at such a IM grid point. Another method, the 'radius
    ! method', searches all projected GCM points within a certain radius and interpolates with help
    ! of these points to obtain the field value at such a IM grid point. Finally the projected and
    ! interpolated IM fields are written to an IM netcdf file.
    !
    ! The GCM geographical coordinates are in longitude (lon) and latitude (lat) in degrees, while the
    ! IM rectangular coordinates are in x and y in meters. The (lon,lat) coordinates are defined in the
    ! curved spherical surface S, and the (x,y) coordinates in the flat surface S'. For a more extended
    ! description of the projection and the interpolation method see:
    !  Reerink et al. (2010), Mapping technique of climate fields between GCM's and ice models, GMD
    !
    ! In the NAMELIST or config file, several options can be changed without compiling the program.
    ! For example the center of the area of interest (the center of the projected area) can be specified
    ! by setting the:
    !   lamda_M_config = 319  (value for the case of Greenland)
    !   phi_M_config   =  72  (value for the case of Greenland)
    ! in the config file. The exact (inverse) oblique stereographic projection can be chosen with
    !   alpha_stereographic_config = 7.1 (value for the case of Greenland)
    ! The center of the IM grid will coincide with (lamda_M_config,phi_M_config), and the extensions of
    ! the IM grid are determined by the IM grid spacings C%dx and C%dy and the IM grid sizes C%NX and C%NY.
