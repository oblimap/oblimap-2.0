  SUBROUTINE oblimap_im_to_gcm_mapping()
    ! This program reads several field variables from a rectangular Ice Model (IM) netcdf file which
    ! are projected by an inverse oblique stereographic projection on a Global Circulation Model (GCM)
    ! grid. The IM grid point coordinates are projected on the GCM grid, where in general they fall
    ! irregular and between the GCM grid points. Therefore the field values defined on the IM grid
    ! points have to be interpolated at each GCM grid point, with help of the nearby projected IM
    ! grid points. Two interpolation methods are available in this program both based on a distance
    ! weigthing Shepard technique. One method, the 'quadrant method', searches within each quadrant
    ! around each GCM grid point the nearest projected IM point and interpolates with help of this
    ! four points to obtain the field value at such a GCM grid point. Another method, the 'radius
    ! method', searches all projected IM points within a certain radius and interpolates with help
    ! of these points to obtain the field value at such a GCM grid point. Finally the projected and
    ! interpolated GCM fields are written to a GCM netcdf file. The GCM points which were not affected
    ! by the mapping (= projection + interpolation) remain their values as before.
    !
    ! The GCM geographical coordinates are in longitude (lon) and latitude (lat) in degrees, while the
    ! IM rectangular coordinates are in x and y in meters. The (lon,lat) coordinates are defined in the
    ! curved spherical surface S, and the (x,y) coordinates in the flat surface S'. For a more extended
    ! description of the projection and the interpolation method see:
    !  Reerink et al. (2010), Mapping technique of climate fields between GCM's and ice models, GMD
    !
    ! In the NAMELIST or config file, several options can be changed without compiling the program.
    ! For example the center of the area of interest (the center of the projected area) can be specified
    ! by setting the:
    !   lamda_M_config = 319  (value for the case of Greenland)
    !   phi_M_config   =  72  (value for the case of Greenland)
    ! in the config file. The exact (inverse) oblique stereographic projection can be chosen with
    !   alpha_stereographic_config = 7.1 (value for the case of Greenland)
    ! The center of the IM grid will coincide with (lamda_M_config,phi_M_config), and the extensions of
    ! the IM grid are determined by the IM grid spacings C%dx and C%dy and the IM grid sizes C%NX and C%NY.
    !
    !
    ! For the mapping from IM to GCM we make use of initial_gcm_field_*, mapped_gcm_field_*, and gcm_field_*.
    !
    ! initial_gcm_field_*
    !   Contains the initial GCM fields. This fields are used because a large part of each GCM field is
    !   unaffected by the to and fro mapping because the IM grid is only local.
    !   The unaffected (mapping_participation_mask(i,j) == 0) field values of the initial fields are
    !   afterwards merged with the to and fro mapped values. Besides in the 'scan' phase the longitude
    !   and latitude coordinates of the GCM grid points have to be read from the GCM file which contains
    !   these initial_gcm_field_* fields.
    !
    ! mapped_gcm_field_*
    !   Contains the GCM fields which are mapped (= projected + interpolated) from the IM grid on to the GCM
    !   grid, these fields only have non-zero values on the grid points (i,j) with:
    !    mapping_participation_mask(i,j) == 1.
    !
    ! gcm_field_*
    !   Contains the to and fro mapped GCM fields merged with the initial_gcm_field_*.
