Compilation of the OBLIMAP 2.0 fortran source code:

 Check which fortran compiler you are using. The default Makefile.include 
 in the Makefile is
  
  Makefile.gfortran
 
 However others can be included instead:
  Makefile.gfortran-mp-4.9-mac
  Makefile.gfortran-lisa
  Makefile.ifort-lisa
  Makefile.ftn-cca-ecmwf
  Makefile.ifort-stampede

 In the Makefile.* one should check the NETCDF path, in our default this is:
  
  NETCDF_DIR = /usr/local
 
 After these checks / adjustments you can compile the OBLIMAP source by
 
  cd src/
  make all
  
 Default running should be done from the  oblimap-package/  directory, for
 instance with:

  ./src/oblimap_gcm_to_im_program config-files/oblimap/ccsm-to-im/config_oblimap_ccsm_to_im_greenland

 And for the reverse direction with:

  ./src/oblimap_im_to_gcm_program config-files/oblimap/im-to-ccsm/config_oblimap_im_to_ccsm_greenland
  
 Or with the tiny script (which includes cpu profiling):

  ./oblimap-to-and-fro-mapping.csh
