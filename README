 Compilation of the OBLIMAP 2.0 fortran source code:

  Check which fortran compiler you are using. The default Makefile.include 
  in the Makefile is

   Makefile.gfortran

  However others can be included instead:
   Makefile.gfortran-mp-4.9-mac
   Makefile.gfortran-lisa
   Makefile.ifort-lisa
   Makefile.ftn-cca-ecmwf
   Makefile.ifort-stampede

  In the Makefile.* one should check the NETCDF path, in our default this is:

   NETCDF_DIR = /usr/local

  After these checks / adjustments you can compile the OBLIMAP source by

   cd src/
   make all

 Default running should be done from the  oblimap-package/  directory, for
 instance with:

   ./src/oblimap_gcm_to_im_program config-files/oblimap/ccsm-to-im/config_oblimap_ccsm_to_im_greenland

  And for the reverse direction with:

   ./src/oblimap_im_to_gcm_program config-files/oblimap/im-to-ccsm/config_oblimap_im_to_ccsm_greenland

  Or with the tiny script (which includes cpu profiling):

   ./oblimap-to-and-fro-mapping.csh
